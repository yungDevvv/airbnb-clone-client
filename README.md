# Airbnb Clone Project

## Description
This is a full-stack web application project that serves as a clone of Airbnb. It allows users to search for and book accommodations, similar to Airbnb. Users can browse through a variety of listings, view details about properties, make reservations, and more. The project is built to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack web development.

Perhaps it was a mistake for a novice full-stack programmer to do such an almost big project. At the end i was not implementing some features that i thougth about. A lot of time was spent designing the project, thinking about the design, creating custom components, and the logic of how everything should work (that’s why I didn't started doing responsive design). And i think it's enough to show my fullstack development progress. I did not used the best application architecture, as well as not the best CSS code and its structure, i understand this. During the development of this project and its design, I learned a lot of new things and a lot of useful things for future projects. 

I will approach the next project more attentively and use all the knowledge and experience accumulated during the creation of this project.

## Good to know
  - No responsive design
  - Some of amenities doesn't actually match
  - Some forms don't have strong validation logic
